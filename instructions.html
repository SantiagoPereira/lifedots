 <p>
Every dot represents a period of four months, within the time of your life expectancy, and three dots represent one year. The blue ones are the periods you already lived, and the red ones, the periods you have left. The green ones represent the time you will (probably) spend doing things like studying, working or sleeping. Remember that this is just a calculation based on demographic data, and does not strictly represent your life in particular. Are you ready?
